        I&apos;m a passionate Senior Web Developer with over 10 years of
        experience building modern, responsive, and high-performance web
        applications. My journey in web development began with a fascination for
        creating interactive experiences, and it has evolved into a career
        focused on delivering exceptional digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack development, with expertise in JavaScript
        frameworks like React, and Next on the frontend, and Node.js, Express,
        Nest, and various databases on the backend. I&apos;m committed to
        writing clean, maintainable code and staying current with emerging
        technologies and best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me mentoring junior developers,
        or exploring new technologies through side projects. I believe in
        continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
